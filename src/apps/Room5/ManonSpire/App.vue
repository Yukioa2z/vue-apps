  Created by filmmaker Jimmy Chin, you can climb to the top of 1 World Trade Center in 360ยบ video with NYT [New York Times] VR. 360ยบ video is a remediation of conventional film. It occupies a position between film and 3D virtual reality. Like film, it is dynamic but not fully interactive. Like 3D VR, the video image completely surrounds the viewer.
