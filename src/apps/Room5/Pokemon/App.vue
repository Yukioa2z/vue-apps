	  <div class="squareoff">Pokemon Go (2016) is perhaps still the best-known AR game. 
      The Pokemon franchise was already decades old, and this was certainly part of the 
      answer for the AR gameâ€™s surprising impact. 
      It was the first Pokemon game on a mobile phone and the first free Pokemon game on any platform.
