Paris attended one of the first public demonstrations of the Lumière brothers’ all-in-one camera and projector: the cinématographe. One of the films 
shown was The Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat Station. All that happens 
in the approximately fifty-second film is that a steam engine and several 
passenger cars pull into the station and glide to a stop. As the train comes 
closer, some in the audience panic. Imagining that the train is going to burst 
out of the screen into the room, they leave their seats and rush for the door."</div>
