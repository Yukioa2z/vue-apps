Linear perspective is a system developed by architects and painters to create an illusion of depth on a flat surface. Around 1425, Italian Renaissance architect Filippo Brunelleschi demonstrated how it could make painting as realistic. Using the technique of parallel lines converging in a single vanishing point and a mirror, he painted the Florence Baptistry.
