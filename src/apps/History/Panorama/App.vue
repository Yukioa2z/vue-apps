The panorama conceived by artist Robert Barker was one of the ways to represent reality at the end of the 18th century. Barker used perspective painting to create a panorama on a canvas stretched around the cylindrical surface. Viewers stood in the middle and experienced the scene in either direction. Therefore, the panoramas were fully immersive virtual environments consisting of a painted canvas.
