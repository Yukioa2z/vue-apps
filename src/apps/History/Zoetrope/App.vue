  Zoetrope is one of the pre-film devices that produced the illusion of motion by displaying a sequence of drawing or photographs showing progressive phases of that motion. It is consisted of a cylinder with vertical slits along the side. The inner surface of the cylinder features a row of sequential images. When it rotates at a high speed, the user can see the rapid succession of images through one of the slits on the cylinder, which create the ilusion of motion.
