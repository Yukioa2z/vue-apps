In 2012, Palmer Luckey released a Kickstarter for the Oculus Rift, a personal Virtual Reality headset that would be more publicly available and affordable than previous VR headsets. In March of 2013, the Oculus Development Kit 1 was released and allowed customers to play VR games with a controller. At this point, the headset only used a gyroscope, accelerometer, and magnetometer. Over time, the Oculus grew, and HTC made the Vive as a competitor. In this time, technological improvements had allowed for people wearing the headsets to move around in a small space and have their position tracked. These improvements also included specialized controllers that would also track the movements of the user's hands.
