  AOne of the most famous trompe l’oeil was the fresco on walls or ceilings of the Sant’Ignazio Church in Rome painted by Andrea Pozzo. If a viewer stands in the right spot, the perspective lines up perfectly, as if the vault opens to the heavens. It locates the viewer in a hybrid space that is part physical and part virtual. It is therefore, in a sense, a forerunner of AR as it combines the physical and the virtual. In another sense, it was a forerunner of VR in that it blended the painting into the whole building to create a seamless environment.
