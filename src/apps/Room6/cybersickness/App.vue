   The term cybersickness, or visually induced motion sickness, has been coined to describe symptoms including headache, nausea, eye strain, dizziness, fatigue, or even vomiting that may occur during or after exposure to a virtual environment. Cybersickness is visceral evidence that VR is not the medium to end all media. Cybersickness reminds the susceptible user of the medium in a powerful way. Nausea replaces astonishment.
